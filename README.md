# Mini-SIEM

A simple, modular, and extensible *Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)* system designed for learning and demonstration purposes. This project ingests logs from multiple sources, normalizes them into a common schema, applies detection rules, generates alerts, and presents them on a user-friendly dashboard.

## Features
- *Log ingestion:* Ingests authentication and web server logs.
- *Normalization:* Converts raw logs into a standarized format.
- *Detection Engine:* Runs simple detection rules like brute-force and web scanning.
- *Alerting:* Generates alerts and allows case management.
- *Dashboard:* Provides a simple, interactive web interface to search logs, view alerts, and investigate incidents.
- *Scalable:* Can be extended to support more log sources, detection rules, and data storage.
